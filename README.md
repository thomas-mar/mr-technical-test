A simple product details section for a clothing site with cart functionality to store a customerâ€™s product selections. The clothing site will comprise a client-side app in Javascript, HTML, CSS.

Several additional asumptions and edge cases handled:

- Font negligible - using default Bootstrap font.
- Only available option is Size.
- As size is required, no need for implementaton of deselecting option.
- Added a Empty cart message when no items selected.
- Added additional Clear Cart logic implented. This is commented out due to not in requirements.
